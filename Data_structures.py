# Array
# array is a list with indexes at each value, uses zero base programming when inserting values you need to change the size memory in the computer leeding to slower insert and delete times but fast read times because everything is stored in contingious order

# Linked List
# consists of nodes that point to the next element so only uses the amount of space you need leeding to faster insert and delete times but slow at reading because un-indexed and can be stored in any order.
